// for (: This is the beginning of a for loop, which is a control structure used to repeat a certain block of code a specified number of times.

//   let i = 0;: Here, you're initializing a variable i with the value 0.
//  This variable will be used to keep track of the current index of the string as you iterate through it.
  
//   i < str.length;: This is the condition that determines when the loop should continue running. 
// The loop will continue as long as the value of i is less than the length of the string str. 
// The str.length gives the total number of characters in the string.
  
//   i++: After each iteration of the loop, this statement increments the value of i by 
// 1. This means that in each iteration, you'll move to the next character in the string.
  
//   ) {: The closing parenthesis marks the end of the loop initialization and condition, and the opening curly brace { indicates the beginning of the loop's code block.
  
//   console.log(str[i]);: Inside the loop, this line uses the console.log() function to print the character at the current index i of the string str. 
// str[i] accesses the character at the index i within the string.
  
//   }: This closing curly brace marks the end of the loop's code block.
